                <h2>Who I Am-</h2>
                <h3>I’m Donna Marie C. Siobal, currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering 
                at Pangasinan State University Urdaneta Campus. Having some knowledge about the syntax and algorithms 
                of C++, Java, and Python. I love playing mobile games, especially mobile legends, and that inspires me 
                to become part of their team to share the ideas that I have and showcase my capability.  </br>
                <br>Away from the keyboard in my spare time, I usually watch Korean dramas that inspire me to work harder 
                to visit Korea and meet those famous celebrities that I adore. In addition, having fun with my dogs is one 
                of the greatest moments that I will treasure in my life as they bring out the child on me. </br> 
                <br>I’m good at building a relationship with other people thus, they can easily approach me and 
                communicate without hesitation. As a dedicated, industrious, and result-oriented woman, I strive to get 
                the greatest possible outcome in every endeavor I do.</h3>

                <p>C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable 
                computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages.
                It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher
                 degree of control over memory and system resources.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">Java</h1>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed 
                for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application
                development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing 
                Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.</p>
